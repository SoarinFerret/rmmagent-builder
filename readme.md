# RMM Agent Builder

This builds the [agents](https://github.com/amidaware/rmmagent) for the rmm used in my test environments.

## Note

[TacticalRMM](https://github.com/amidaware/tacticalrmm) is an awesome example of source-available licensed code. Please consider sponsoring the project if you are able to.
